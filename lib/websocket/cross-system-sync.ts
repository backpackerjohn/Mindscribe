 * Placeholder for the real-time synchronization service as specified in PRP 4.
 * In a production environment, this would likely be a WebSocket client
 * connecting to a backend service to handle:
 * - Real-time event broadcasting across systems (e.g., a new thought added)
 * - Update coordination between Brain Dump and Tasks
 * - Bi-directional relationship maintenance
 *
 * For this frontend-only prototype, we can simulate cross-tab communication
 * using the BroadcastChannel API.
